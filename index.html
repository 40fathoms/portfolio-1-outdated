                    In this research we studied thermodynamic properties of the C60 fullerene dimer. Through the model proposed by Girifalco, an analytical function was adjusted to describe the potential energy curve with the Generalized Simulation Annealing method. Values â€‹â€‹of the rovibrational spectroscopic constants were obtained using the Dunham methodology and the Discrete Variables Representation. All calculations were performed utilizing a code developed in Fortran. Thermodynamic properties have been described through a partition function that behaves like a non-rigid anarmonic oscillator.

                    In this project we predicted the chemical element of the third coordination sphere of the EXAFS oscillations in the Nickel-Fluorohectorite. Thus, it was necessary to understand the dynamics of intercalation and diffusion of water in expandable synthetic nanosilicates, to perform a qualitative analysis of the profile of oscillations in the vicinity of the absorbing atom through XAFS-LNLS line measurements as a function of temperature variation with humidity in the nanosilicate. Afterwards, we defined the structural parameters, changes in the hydration regime and separation between the platelets. Therefore, we obtained structural information on the sample's absorption spectrum from the third coordination sphere, determining the chemical element we looked for. Lastly, through the min-max method, we determined the interatomic distance between the intercalating ion of a sample of Ni-FHT and its neighboring atoms in the first and second coordination spheres.
